class BaseGuard:
    """Base class for creating route guards in PyNest.
    
    Guards provide a way to implement authentication and authorization logic
    that can be applied to controllers or individual routes. They are fully
    compatible with FastAPI's security system and OpenAPI documentation.
    
    **Security Scheme Integration:**
    
    If ``security_scheme`` is set to an instance of ``fastapi.security.SecurityBase``,
    the guard will:
    - Be injected with credentials from that security scheme
    - Appear in the generated OpenAPI schema with appropriate security requirements
    - Show an "Authorize" button in Swagger UI
    - Allow users to authenticate through the interactive documentation
    
    **Supported Security Schemes:**
    
    PyNest guards support all FastAPI security schemes:
    
    * **API Keys** (``fastapi.security.APIKeyHeader``, ``APIKeyQuery``, ``APIKeyCookie``)
    * **HTTP Authentication** (``HTTPBasic``, ``HTTPBearer``, ``HTTPDigest``)
    * **OAuth2** (``OAuth2PasswordBearer``, ``OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer``)
    * **OpenID Connect** (``OpenIdConnect``)
    
    **Examples:**
    
    **1. Simple Guard (No Security Scheme):**
    
    ```python
    class SimpleGuard(BaseGuard):
        def can_activate(self, request: Request, credentials=None) -> bool:
            # Custom logic without OpenAPI documentation
            return request.headers.get("X-Custom-Header") == "allowed"
    ```
    
    **2. API Key Header Guard:**
    
    ```python
    from fastapi.security import APIKeyHeader
    
    class APIKeyGuard(BaseGuard):
        security_scheme = APIKeyHeader(
            name="X-API-Key", 
            description="API Key for authentication"
        )
        
        def can_activate(self, request: Request, credentials=None) -> bool:
            # credentials contains the API key value
            return credentials == "your-secret-api-key"
    ```
    
    **3. Bearer Token Guard:**
    
    ```python
    from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
    
    class BearerTokenGuard(BaseGuard):
        security_scheme = HTTPBearer(description="Bearer token")
        
        def can_activate(self, request: Request, credentials=None) -> bool:
            # credentials is an HTTPAuthorizationCredentials object
            if credentials and credentials.scheme == "Bearer":
                return self.validate_jwt_token(credentials.credentials)
            return False
            
        def validate_jwt_token(self, token: str) -> bool:
            # Implement JWT validation logic
            return token == "valid-jwt-token"
    ```
    
    **4. Basic Authentication Guard:**
    
    ```python
    from fastapi.security import HTTPBasic
    
    class BasicAuthGuard(BaseGuard):
        security_scheme = HTTPBasic(description="Basic HTTP authentication")
        
        def can_activate(self, request: Request, credentials=None) -> bool:
            # credentials is an HTTPBasicCredentials object
            if credentials:
                return (credentials.username == "admin" and 
                       credentials.password == "secret")
            return False
    ```
    
    **5. OAuth2 Password Bearer Guard:**
    
    ```python
    from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
    
    class OAuth2Guard(BaseGuard):
        security_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(
            tokenUrl="token",
            description="OAuth2 with Password and Bearer"
        )
        
        def can_activate(self, request: Request, credentials=None) -> bool:
            # credentials contains the OAuth2 token
            return self.validate_oauth2_token(credentials)
            
        def validate_oauth2_token(self, token: str) -> bool:
            # Implement OAuth2 token validation
            return token and len(token) > 20
    ```
    
    **6. Multi-Scope OAuth2 Guard:**
    
    ```python
    from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
    
    class AdminGuard(BaseGuard):
        security_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(
            tokenUrl="token",
            scopes={
                "read": "Read access", 
                "write": "Write access",
                "admin": "Admin access"
            }
        )
        
        def can_activate(self, request: Request, credentials=None) -> bool:
            # Validate token and check for admin scope
            return self.has_admin_scope(credentials)
    ```
    
    **7. Cookie Authentication Guard:**
    
    ```python
    from fastapi.security import APIKeyCookie
    
    class CookieGuard(BaseGuard):
        security_scheme = APIKeyCookie(
            name="session_id",
            description="Session cookie"
        )
        
        def can_activate(self, request: Request, credentials=None) -> bool:
            # credentials contains the cookie value
            return self.validate_session(credentials)
    ```
    
    **8. Async Guard Example:**
    
    ```python
    class AsyncGuard(BaseGuard):
        security_scheme = APIKeyHeader(name="X-Token")
        
        async def can_activate(self, request: Request, credentials=None) -> bool:
            # Async validation (e.g., database lookup)
            user = await self.get_user_by_token(credentials)
            return user is not None
            
        async def get_user_by_token(self, token: str):
            # Async database call
            pass
    ```
    
    **Usage with Controllers:**
    
    ```python
    @Controller("users")
    @UseGuards(APIKeyGuard, AdminGuard)  # Multiple guards
    class UserController:
        pass
        
    @Controller("public")
    class PublicController:
        
        @Get("/protected")
        @UseGuards(BearerTokenGuard)  # Route-level guard
        def protected_route(self):
            return {"message": "This is protected"}
    ```
    
    **Error Handling:**
    
    Guards automatically raise ``HTTPException`` with status 403 (Forbidden)
    when ``can_activate`` returns ``False``. You can customize error handling
    by overriding the ``__call__`` method.
    
    **OpenAPI Documentation:**
    
    When using security schemes, guards automatically:
    - Add security requirements to OpenAPI schema
    - Display "Authorize" button in Swagger UI
    - Show required headers/parameters in API documentation
    - Enable interactive authentication testing

    Guards provide authentication and authorization for your API endpoints.

    or at individual route methods.
    
    Args:
        *guards: One or more guard classes (not instances) to apply
        
    **Usage Examples:**
    
    **Controller-level protection:**
    ```python
    @Controller("admin")
    @UseGuards(AdminGuard, RateLimitGuard)
    class AdminController:
        # All routes in this controller are protected
        pass
    ```
    
    **Route-level protection:**
    ```python
    @Controller("users")
    class UserController:
        
        @Get("/public")
        def public_endpoint(self):
            return {"message": "No auth required"}

            return {"message": "Admin access required"}
    ```
    
    **Guard Execution Order:**
    
    Guards are executed in the order they are specified. If any guard fails,
    subsequent guards are not executed and a 403 error is returned.
    
    **Combining with FastAPI Dependencies:**
    
    Guards work alongside FastAPI's native dependency system and can be
    combined with other dependencies:
    
    ```python
    @Get("/users/{user_id}")
    @UseGuards(AuthGuard)
    def get_user(user_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
        # Both guard and dependency are executed
        pass
    ```
    
    **Security in OpenAPI:**
    
    When guards use security schemes, they automatically appear in:
    - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
    - Interactive API testing interface
    - Generated client code
    
    Returns:
        Callable: Decorator function that applies guards to the target
