# PyNest CLI Deep Dive 🔍

The PyNest CLI is a powerful tool that helps you quickly scaffold, develop, and manage your PyNest applications. This guide will walk you through all the commands and best practices to make the most out of the PyNest CLI.

## Installation 💻

Before using the PyNest CLI, ensure you have it installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pynest-api
```

## CLI Commands and Usage 🛠️
The PyNest CLI provides a variety of commands to help you create and manage your PyNest applications. Below are the detailed descriptions of the available commands and their usage.

### create-nest-app
Create a new PyNest application.

```bash
pynest create-nest-app --app-name <app_name> [--db-type <db_type>] [--is-async]
```
**Options**

* `--app-name`, `-n`: The name of the new application. (Required)
* `--db-type`, `-db`: The type of database to use (postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mongodb). (Optional)
* `--is-async`: Whether the project should be async or not. This is applicable only for relational databases. (Optional)

#### Example
```bash
pynest create-nest-app --app-name my_pynest_app --db-type postgresql --is-async
```

This example will create a skeleton PyNest application named `my_pynest_app` with PostgreSQL as the database and async support.

#### File Structure 🗂️
Here's the typical file structure of a PyNest application generated by the CLI:

```text
my_pynest_app/
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── app_module.py
│   ├── app_controller.py
│   ├── app_service.py
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

Note: The actual file structure may vary based on the modules and components you create.:


### generate (Alias: g)
Generate boilerplate code for various components of the application.

#### Subcommands

**module**
Generate a new module with the associated controller, service, model and module files._

```bash
pynest g module --name <module_name>
```

**Options**


* `--name`, `-n`: The name of the new module. (Required)

**Example**
```bash
pynest g module --name users
```

This will create a new module named `users` with the associated controller, service, model and module files.

Note: In the future the cli will support more subcommands like `controller`, `service`, `model` and `provider` and `resource` that will replace the current `g module` as in nestjs cli:



## Best Practices 🌟

To ensure a clean and maintainable codebase, follow these best practices when using the PyNest CLI:

* **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming conventions for files and directories. For example, use lowercase with underscores for module names (users_module.py) and camelCase for class names (UsersController)._

* **Modular Structure**: Keep your code modular. Each module should encapsulate a specific functionality of your application.

* **Service Layer**: Keep business logic within services to maintain separation of concerns. Controllers should handle HTTP requests and responses only.

* **Dependency Injection**: Use dependency injection to manage dependencies between services and controllers. This makes your code more testable and maintainable.

* **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables to manage configuration settings, such as database connection strings and API keys.

The PyNest CLI is a powerful tool that simplifies the development of PyNest applications. By following the best practices and utilizing the commands effectively, you can build scalable and maintainable applications with ease. Happy coding!
