# PyNest CLI Deep Dive 🔍

The PyNest CLI is a powerful tool that helps you quickly scaffold, develop, and manage your PyNest applications. This guide will walk you through all the commands and best practices to make the most out of the PyNest CLI.

## Installation 💻

Before using the PyNest CLI, ensure you have it installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pynest-api
```

## CLI Commands and Usage 🛠️
The PyNest CLI provides a variety of commands to help you create and manage your PyNest applications. Below are the detailed descriptions of the available commands and their usage.

### Generate New Application
Create a new PyNest application.

```bash
pynest generate application --app-name <app_name> [--db-type <db_type>] [--is-async]
```
**Options**

* `--app-name`, `-n`: The name of the new application. (Required)
* `--db-type`, `-db`: The type of database to use (postgresql, mysql, sqlite, mongodb). (Optional)
* `--is-async`: Whether the project should be async or not. This is applicable only for relational databases. (Optional)
* `--is-cli`: Whether the project should be a CLI App. (Optional)

#### Example
```bash
pynest generate application --app-name my_pynest_app --db-type postgresql --is-async
```

This example will create a skeleton PyNest application named `my_pynest_app` with PostgreSQL as the database and async support.

#### File Structure 🗂️
Here's the typical file structure of a PyNest application generated by the CLI:

```text
my_pynest_app/
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── app_module.py
│   ├── app_controller.py
│   ├── app_service.py
│   ├── config.py
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

!Note: The actual file structure may vary based on the modules and components you create


### generate command
Generate boilerplate code for various components of the application.

#### Subcommands

**Resource**
Generate a new resource with the associated controller, service, model and module files, with respect to the project configurations (e.g. database type).

```bash
pynest generate resource --name <module_name>
```

**Options**


* `--name`, `-n`: The name of the new module. (Required)
* `--path`, `-p`: The path where the module should be created. (Optional)

**Example**
```bash
pynest generate resource --name users
```

This will create a new resource named `users` with the associated controller, service, model and module files.


**Module**

Generate a new module file, which can be used to group related components of the application.

```bash
pynest generate module --name <module_name>
``` 

**Options**

* `--name`, `-n`: The name of the new module. (Required)
* `--path`, `-p`: The path where the module should be created. (Optional)

**Example**
```bash
pynest generate module --name auth
```

This will create a new module named `auth` in the default path.

**Controller**

Generate a new controller file, which will handle the routing and responses for a specific resource.

```bash
pynest generate controller --name <controller_name>
```

**Options**

* `--name`, `-n`: The name of the new controller. (Required)
* `--path`, `-p`: The path where the controller should be created. (Optional)

**Example**
```bash
pynest generate controller --name users
```

This will create a new controller named `users` in the default path.

**Service**

Generate a new service file, which will contain the business logic for a specific resource.

```bash
pynest generate service --name <service_name>
```

**Options**

* `--name`, `-n`: The name of the new service. (Required)
* `--path`, `-p`: The path where the service should be created. (Optional)

**Example**
```bash
pynest generate service --name users
```

This will create a new service named `users` in the default path.


## Best Practices 🌟

To ensure a clean and maintainable codebase, follow these best practices when using the PyNest CLI:

* **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming conventions for files and directories. For example, use lowercase with underscores for module names (users_module.py) and camelCase for class names (UsersController)._

* **Modular Structure**: Keep your code modular. Each module should encapsulate a specific functionality of your application.

* **Service Layer**: Keep business logic within services to maintain separation of concerns. Controllers should handle HTTP requests and responses only.

* **Dependency Injection**: Use dependency injection to manage dependencies between services and controllers. This makes your code more testable and maintainable.

* **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables to manage configuration settings, such as database connection strings and API keys.

The PyNest CLI is a powerful tool that simplifies the development of PyNest applications. By following the best practices and utilizing the commands effectively, you can build scalable and maintainable applications with ease. Happy coding!
